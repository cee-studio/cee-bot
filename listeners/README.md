# Interaction Listeners

## Activate interaction listeners in your guild

Before you get started, make sure to locate the `cee_bot` field of your bot's `config.json`, and
update it with your guild primitives.

Once you are ready, you can come back to this folder and continue:

1. Build executables:
  ```bash
  $ make
  ```
2. (optional) Modify the default listeners by editing the sub-folder's JSON files.
3. Run executables with the relative path of the listener JSON to be activated
  **Example:**
  ```bash
  $ ./menu mentorship-channel/menu.json
  ```
